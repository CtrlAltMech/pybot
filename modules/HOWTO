Modules are loaded dynamically from this directory by the bot's load_modules function. Each module must define an __init__ function with the following signature: (self, events=None, printer_handle=None, bot=None), as well as a handle function, with the following signature:  (self, event). 

Any more is gravy. Inside the init function, either subscribe to an existing event, or create your own, and ask the bot to register it.
An excellent example is in modules/example.py.
