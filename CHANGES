v0.4
====

  Config now written in JSON. To sum up recent changes in the last week, since there have been a few:
  * bot is now multithreaded. He joins n-number of specified networks in the config file, and joins channels on a 
  per-network basis.
 
 Issues:
 -------
  * IRC pass and DB pass must be specified in each network block, as each thread is really only concerned with 
  information relevant to itself; specific to its own network. This is probably not how the bot would be used;
  it's likely he'd be running on one machine, with one DB password. IRC pass per-network makes sense, though.
  
  * Code still very much needs to be cleaned up and restructured. 

  * bot class still passing only PRIVMSGs to botbrain -- for events to be really useful (see Future), JOINS, PARTS,
  etc would need to get passed as well.

 Future:
 -------
  * Events and module handling. For modules to be useful (and usable) they'd have to be able to register, or subscribe,
  to interesting (or uninteresting, I'm not judging you) 'events' as determined by the botbrain. The bot needs to
  merely pass lines received into botbrain, where logic is performed. Both events and how to load modules (as well 
  as module conventions) need to be defined.
